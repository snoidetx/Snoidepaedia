## Modules in NUS

In NUS, a **module** means a course. The total amount of modules is calculated via **modular credit** (MC), which is the smallest unit of courses taken by NUS students. Typically, one module consists of 4 MCs. Students have to complete certain number of MCs to apply for graduation.
