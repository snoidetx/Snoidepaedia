I am Xiao <u>Tian</u> (a.k.a. *@snoidetx*), an honours year undergraduate student at [**National University of Singapore**](https://nus.edu.sg/) (NUS) pursuing a double degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I will be graduating in Fall 2024. I also worked at Singtel as a software developer intern in Summer 2022. Check out the [**Experience**](./experience/) section to know more about me.

In Spring 2025, I will be joining NUS again as a Ph.D. in Computer Science student, supervised by [**Prof. Bryan Kian Hsiang Low**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/lowkh/). My research interests include data-centric machine learning, multi-agent machine learning and privacy-preserving machine learning. Refer to my [**Research**](./research/) page to find out more about my research and past works.

I have also been working as teaching assistant in NUS School of Computing. Refer to the [**Teaching**](./teaching/) section to know about the courses I have taught.
