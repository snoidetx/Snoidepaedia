I am Xiao <u>Tian</u> (a.k.a. *@snoidetx*), an incoming Ph.D. in Computer Science student at [**National University of Singapore**](https://nus.edu.sg/) (NUS), starting from Spring 2025. I am fortunate to be supervised by [**Prof. Bryan Kian Hsiang Low**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/lowkh/). Currently, I am an honours year undergraduate student at NUS pursuing a **double honours degree** in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. My research interests include **data-centric machine learning**, **multi-agent machine learning** and **privacy-preserving machine learning**. Refer to my [**Research**](./research/) page to find out more about my research and past works. I have also been working as teaching assistant in NUS School of Computing. Refer to my [**Teaching**](./teaching/) page to know about the courses I have taught.
