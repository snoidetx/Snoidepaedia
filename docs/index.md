## Get Started

***[Snoidepaedia](../)*** is an online documentation archive of *[@snoidetx](../about/)*. Click on the **Bulletin** button to start browsing through all entries stored in *Snoidepaedia*. Click on the **About *@snoidetx*** button to know more about the author. Enjoy your journey!

### How is *Snoidepaedia* different from *snoidetx.github.io*?

***Snoidepaedia*** is a documentation archive, while *snoidetx.github.io* is a portfolio website. One allows you to browse through documents *@snoidetx* possesses, while the other helps you better know about *@snoidetx* as a person.

However, note that the two will be integrated into ***Snoidepaedia*** in future.
