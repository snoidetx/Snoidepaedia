I am **Xiao <u>Tian</u>**, a **Ph.D. in Computer Science** student at [**National University of Singapore**](https://nus.edu.sg/) (NUS), starting from Spring 2025. I am fortunate to be supervised by [**Prof. Bryan Kian Hsiang Low**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/lowkh/). My research interests include **data-centric machine learning**, **multi-agent machine learning** and **privacy-preserving machine learning**. Refer to my [**Research**](./research/) page to find out more about my research and past works. I have also been working as **teaching assistant** in NUS School of Computing. Refer to my [**Teaching**](./teaching/) page to know about the courses I have taught. 

I obtained my **Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics (Honours)** and **Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science (Honours)** degrees from NUS in Fall 2024. Check out my **résumé** above to know more about me!

Fun fact: ***Snoíde*** is my pseudonym.
