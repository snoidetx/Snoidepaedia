I am Xiao <u>Tian</u> (a.k.a. *@snoidetx*), an honours year undergraduate student at **National University of Singapore** (NUS) pursuing a double degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I will be graduating in Fall 2024. I also worked at Singtel as a software developer intern. Click on the **About Me** button above to know more about me.

In Spring 2025, I will be joining NUS again as a Ph.D. in Computer Science student, supervised by [**Bryan Kian Hsiang Low**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/lowkh/). My research interests include data-centric machine learning, multi-agent machine learning and privacy-preserving machine learning.
