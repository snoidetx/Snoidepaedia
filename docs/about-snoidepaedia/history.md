Once upon a time, *@snoidetx*'s personal website was hosted on <u>blogspot.com</u> using the tool [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/). It was a good tool for you to build your website quickly if you are new to information technology.

<ins>snoidetx.github.io</ins> had served as the personal website of *@snoidetx* for one year, before its depreciation on 21/06/2022. However, in memory of its contribution, you can still view an archived version of the former <ins>snoidetx.github.io</ins> by clicking the **View** button.

The structures of the old <ins>snoidetx.github.io</ins> are largely inherited by the current Snoídepaedia. Now, <u>snoidetx.github.io</u> becomes a shortcut to the **Home** page of Snoídepaedia.
