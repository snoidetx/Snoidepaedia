The following version of my undergraduate transcript was uploaded on 24 June 2024. Since I have not graduated from NUS yet, the transcript is not complete and is an **unofficial** version. Please approach me in person if you need my official transcript.

You may also click on the **Academic Plan** button to refer to my academic plan for my undergraduated studies if that helps (e.g., if you are a freshman).
