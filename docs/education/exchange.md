In Fall 2023, I was enrolled into [**Tokyo Institute of Technology**](https://www.titech.ac.jp/) (Tokyo Tech, Japanese: 東京工業大学) through [**Student Exchange Programme**](https://www.titech.ac.jp/) (SEP), which composed my 5-month life in Japan. Here is a list of courses I took:

* ART.T466 3D Computer Vision
* GEG.T414 Linear Wave Theory and Simulation
* LAJ.J401 Basic Japanese 1
* LAJ.J412 Basic Japanese 2
* MCS.T405 Theory of Algorithms
* SCE.A402 Advanced Course of Sensing System Theory
* SCE.A405 Inverse Problems and Data Assimilation
* SCE.I435 Visual and Knowledge Information Processing

I stayed at Shofu Dormitory in Aobadai, Yokohama, a nice and quiet place.
