## Teaching Background

### Teaching as Volunteer

*@snoidetx* has been keen on teaching. He was passionate about answering questions from his peers when he was in school, and took part in many volunteer activities about teaching. While in NJC, *@snoidetx* initiated [**Peer Mentorship Programme @Kebun Baru Community Centre**](https://www.onepa.gov.sg/cc/kebun-baru-cc) to provide free mentorship and tutorship for underprivileged children. After getting into NUS, *@snoidetx* joined the [**NUS Teach Singapore**](https://nus.edu.sg/osa/student-life/community-engagement/teach-sg) initiative and provided academic coaching and mentoring to children and teenagers under Christ Church Secondary School Champions Youth Tuition Programme.

### Teaching Assistant in NUS

NUS School of Computing (SOC) offers a great initiative for undergraduate students to work part-time as teaching assistant (TA). *@snoidetx* has been actively participating in this initiative and started his TA career in Fall 2021, when he worked as a TA for CS2040/S Data Structures and Algorithms.
