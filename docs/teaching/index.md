The table below shows the teaching ratings I received from my students for each of the courses I taught, in comparison to the faculty average rating at NUS School of Computing.

## Teaching as Volunteer

When I was in NJC, I initiated the [**Peer Mentorship Programme @Kebun Baru Community Centre**](https://www.onepa.gov.sg/cc/kebun-baru-cc) to provide free mentorship and tutorship for underprivileged children. After getting into NUS, I joined the [**NUS Teach Singapore**](https://nus.edu.sg/osa/student-life/community-engagement/teach-sg) initiative and provided academic coaching and mentoring to children and teenagers under Christ Church Secondary School Champions Youth Tuition Programme.
