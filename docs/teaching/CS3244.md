## Overview

I taught the module in Fall 2022 under Prof. Min-Yen Kan and Prof. Brian Lim. I was in charge of Tutorial Group 3 and worked very hard to deliver good contents and give useful feedbacks. I also mentored Project Group 7, 11 and 26 about their machine learning project on HDB resale datasets.

I taught the module in Spring 2023 again under Prof. Daren Ler and Prof. Anand Bhojan. I was in charge of Tutorial Group 3 and 10.
