## Overview

Scientific research has been one of the favourite activities of *@snoidetx*. When he was very young, he tried to research and write papers about the optimal angle when shooting basketballs. Afterwards, *@snoidetx* has been actively seeking for research opportunities. He took H3 Science Research in National Junior College (NJC), where he got a chance to research in Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) for 1 year. In National University of Singapore (NUS), *@snoidetx* proactively chose modules with research aspect to enrich his research experience. Currently, *@snoidetx* is doing research under the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programme (UROP<sup>[?](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/project/urop/)</sup>), mentored by Prof Bryan Low Kian Hsiang<sup>[?](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/lowkh/)</sup>.
