## Abstract

Somatropin is a type of drug used to complement natural somatotropin secreted by human pituitary gland in treating growth hormone deficiency. Its working mechanism is identical to somatotropin - binding to somatotropin receptors, activation of receptors and therefore activation of two signaling pathways, namely JAK-STAT pathway and MAPK pathway. Somatropin is conventionally produced through recombinant DNA technology, which is time-consuming and requires daily administration. More advanced techniques have been developed to improve such drawbacks.
